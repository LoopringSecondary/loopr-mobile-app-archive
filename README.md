### Development 

##### Stack

- No storyboard. It's ok to use xib in the early development. However, if the UI is complicated, please write UI programmatically.
- No subclassing any class in UIKit. We try to keep the code simple. It's better to use extensions.
- No ReactiveSwift. Keep it simple. We prefer to use Cocoa Touch directly.
- No SnapKit at this time.
- [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios): an iOS library to natively render After Effects vector animations
- [Pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop): An extensible iOS and OS X animation library, useful for physics-based interactions.
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint): A tool to enforce Swift style and conventions.
